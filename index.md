# Overview

VSAlertController is a drop-in replacement for UIAlertController. It's designed to mimic UIAlertController's API as closely as possible, while adding addtional styling & behaviorial customization options. VSAlertController is loosely inspired by codeio's [PMAlertController](https://github.com/pmusolino/PMAlertController), but is written in Objective-C rather than Swift and does not use IB files to build its UI. VSAlertController adds the following additional features

* In addition to 'Alert' and 'Action Sheet' styles, VSAlert also provides a 'Walkthrough Alert' style, which is similar to an alert, but is significantly wider.
* Alerts can be optionally displayed with an image
* The background color, text color, text alignment, and text color of your alerts can be configured.
* The animation that is used to show / hide the alert can be configured
* Appearance of alerts can be configured at the per instance level, or globally via [UIAppearance](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiappearance?language=objc).

# Setup

VSAlert is packaged as a **static framework**. Using the compiled static framework is the recommended setup option, but you can also use CocoaPods, or include the source code directly in your target.

### Framework

1. Download the latest stable release [from GitHub](https://github.com/vsanthanam/VSAlert/releases). It contains a compiled static framework as well as a copy of the relevent documentation.
2. Add  `VSAlert.framework`, and have your target link against the framework during the build process.
3. Reference the library by importing the clang module in relevent files with `@import VSAlert;`.

### CocoaPods

1. If you haven't already, download & install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) on your machine.
2. If your project isn't already configured to use CocoaPods, create a podfile & project workpsace:
    <br />
    <br />
    ```
    $ pod init
    ```
3. Add `pod 'VSAlert', '~> 1.4'` to your podfile for the appropriate targets.
4. Install the depedency by running:
    <br />
    <br />
    ```
    $ pod install
    ```
5. Reference the library in the relevent files with `#import <VSAlert/VSAlert.h>`.

More information about the pod is available [here](https://cocoapods.org/pods/VSAlert).

### Direct Source

1. Clone the repository:
    <br />
    <br />
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/vsanthanam/VSAlert.git
    ```

2. Add `VSAlertController.h`, `VSAlertController.m`, `VSAlertAction.h`, and `VSAlertAction.m` to your project.
3. Reference the library in the relevent files with `#import "VSAlertController.h"`.

Alternatively, you can build the `Framework` target for `Generic iOS Device` if you want to compile the static framework yourself. It's output can be found in `{Repo}/Release/VSAlert.framework`.

**Warning:** Using the version of the code on the master branch isn't always production ready. Use one of the other two installation options for production ready releases.

# Usage

### Basics

VSAlertController is designed to mimic the UIAlertController API as closely as possible. Its usage pattern is identical.

1. Create & configure an instance of `VSAlertController`.
2. Create & configure instances of `VSAlertAction` and add them to your alert controller by using it's `-addAction:` instance method.
3. Present your alert by calling UIViewController's `-presentViewController:animated:completion:` instance method on a view controller of your choice.

```objective-c

- (void)showAlert:(id)sender {

    VSAlertController *controller = [VSAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:@"Title" message:@"Message" preferredStyle:VSAlertControllerStyleAlert];
                                                                          
    VSAlertAction *action = [VSAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"OK" style:VSAlertActionStyleCancel action:nil];
    
    [controller addAction:action];
    
    [self presentViewController:controller
                       animated:YES
                     completion:nil];

}

```

### Documentation & Examples

VSAlert is highly customizable, both at the per instance level, as well as globally via UIAppearance. Take a look at the [full documentation](https://code.vsanthanam.com/VSAlert/Documentation/index.html) for more detailed information on customizing your alerts and their actions.

The hosted documentation is based on release 1.4. If you're using any other release, refer to the documentation inlcuded in the repository or release download. 

Documentation is included in HTML format, as well in a`.docset`, so you can easily add it to Xcode, Dash, or any other documentation browser of your choice.

VSAlert also includes an example application featuring several different alert styles and customization options. You can build the `VSAlert-Example` target for the simulator or device of your choice to browser around for inspration, as well as get a demo of some of the customiozation options.

VSAlert allows you to embed images in your alert controllers. We provide a .sketch template and some recommended sizes to get you started.
